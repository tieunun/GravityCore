TITLE:
Gravity Core

PREMISE:
In the future, there is a space station in orbit about the sun, between Earth and Mars.
This space station is very advanced, and even generates its own magnetic field and
has a basic atmosphere around it, not robust enough to sustain life, but enough to
deflect any dangerous solar radiation and particles.  This space station has artificial
gravity, but it is still rather rudimentary, using an array of supermassive objects,
called Gravity Cores (or just Cores for short) in  large compartment below the station.
The negative aspect of this is that this compartment needs to be around 5 times the
volume as the rest of the ship to maintain stability.  something happens to cause
breakdown of the Cores, and the ship's gravity goes haywire, increasing in some areas,
and becoming nonexistant in others.  One of the scientists, Al Hawking, is the lead
maintainence of these Cores, and must venture into the large chambers below, which
contain the Cores.  The cores have broken their hold, but seem mostly stable,
keeping distant from eachother due to their magnetic fields.
